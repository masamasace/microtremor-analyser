Sure, here's the full basic formulation of the Compound Matrix Method using LaTeX:

Let $H$ be a matrix representing the soil properties of the ground, and $A$ be a matrix representing the seismic wave properties. The compound matrix $C$ can be obtained by taking the Kronecker product of $H$ and $A$, such that:

$$
C = H \otimes A
$$

Next, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $C$ can be calculated, which will give us the solution to the ground displacement problem. Specifically, the eigenvectors will tell us the pattern of motion of the ground, while the eigenvalues will give us the amplitude of the motion. In other words, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues will provide a description of the wave field in the soil due to the earthquake.

Finally, the displacement of the ground can be obtained by using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues to decompose the motion of the ground into its component parts. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
u = \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n v_n w_n^T
$$

where $u$ is the ground displacement vector, $\alpha_n$ is the eigenvalue corresponding to the $n$ th eigenvector $v_n$, and $w_n$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the $n$ th eigenvalue. $N$ is the number of eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated.

Certainly! Here's how $H$ and $A$ can be formulated:

Matrix $H$ represents the soil properties of the ground and can be expressed as:

$$
H = \begin{bmatrix}
$rho & 0 & 0 $
0 & $mu & 0 $
0 & 0 & $lambda + 2$mu
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the soil, $\mu$ is the shear modulus, and $\lambda$ is the elastic modulus. The values of these parameters can be obtained through laboratory testing of soil samples or from geological surveys of the area.

Matrix $A$ represents the seismic wave properties and can be expressed as:

$begin{equation}
A = $begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 $
0 & P & 0 $
0 & 0 & 0
$end{bmatrix}
$end{equation}

where $P$ is the pressure wave caused by the earthquake. The amplitude and direction of $P$ can be determined through seismic monitoring and analysis of the earthquake.

Once $H$ and $A$ are determined, the compound matrix $C = H \otimes A$ can be calculated, and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $C$ can be solved for to obtain the ground displacement due to the earthquake.

To formulate the matrix $A$ under three-dimensional field, we need to use the seismic wave equation that describes the propagation of an elastic wave in a solid medium. In a three-dimensional space, the seismic wave equation can be written as:

$$\nabla^2\mathbf{u} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{u}}{\partial t^2} = \mathbf{0}$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the displacement vector, $c$ is the velocity of the seismic wave, and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

We can then write the equation in matrix form as:

$$\left(\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\right) \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is a vector containing the three components of displacement, and $\nabla^2$ and $\partial^2/\partial t^2$ are second-order differential operators.

If we assume that the wave is propagating in the $z$-direction and that the displacement vector has only one non-zero component in this direction, we can write the equation in matrix form as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
This matrix represents the seismic wave properties in three-dimensional space, where the $z$-component of the displacement vector is the only non-zero component. The amplitude and direction of the wave can be determined through seismic monitoring and analysis of the earthquake.
